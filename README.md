Introducing myself: A tech whiz from French Canada who turns geek into chic. 
When he's not decoding binary jokes, he's decoding the latest tech trends. 
Catch him blogging on pald.me, toggling between gadgets, and sipping maple syrup lattes. 
Oui, he's the real CTRL+ALT+DELight in the tech world! 🍁💻🔥
